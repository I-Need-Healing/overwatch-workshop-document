 - `    PLAYER`:The player whose ultimate charge percentage to acquire.


`UP`:Shorthand for the directional vector(o, l, 0), which points upward.


`VALUE IN ARRAY`:The value found at a specific element of an array. Results in o if the element does not exist.
 - `    ARRAY`:The array whose element to acquire.
 - `    INDEX`:The index of the element to acquire.


``:A vector composed of three real numbers (x, y, z) where x is left, y is up, and z is forward. Vectors are used for position, direction, and velocity.


`VECTOR TOWARDS`:The displacement vector from one position to another.
 - `    START POS`:The position from which the resulting displacement vector begins.
 - `    END P05`:The position at which the resulting displacement vector ends.


`VELOCITY OF`:The current velocity of a player as a vector. If the player is on a surface, the y component of this velocity will be o, even when traveling up or down a slope.
 - `    PLAYER`:The player whose velocity to acquire.


`VERTICAL ANGLE FROM DIRECTION`:The vertical angle in degrees corresponding to the specified direction vector.
 - `    DIRECTION`:The direction vector from which to acquire a vertical angle in degrees. The vector is unitized before calculation begins.


`VERTICAL ANGLE TOWARDS`:The vertical angle in degrees from a player's current forward direction to the specified position. The result is positive if the position is below the player. Otherwise, the result is zero or negative.
 - `    PLAYER`:The player from whose current facing the angle begins.
 - `    POSITION`:The position in the world where the angle ends.


`VERTICAL FACING ANGLE OF`:The vertical angle in degrees of a player's current facing relative to the world. This value increases as the player looks down.
 - `    PLAYER`:The player whose vertical facing angle to acquire.


`VERTICAL SPEED OF`:The current vertical speed of a player in meters per second. This measurement excludes all horizontal motion, including motion while traveling up and down slopes.
 - `    PLAYER`:The player whose vertical speed to acquire.


`VICTIM`:The player that received the damage for the event currently being processed by this rule. May be the same as the attacker or the event player.


`WORLD VECTOR OF`:The vector in world coordinates corresponding to the provided vector in local coordinates.
 - `    LOCAL VECTOR`:The vector in local coordinates that will be converted to world coordinates.
 - `    RELATIVE PLAYER`:The player to whom the local vector is relative.
 - `    TKANMUKMAI IUN`:Specifies whether the vector should receive a rotation and a translation (usually applied to positions) or only a rotation (usually applied to directions and velocities).


`X COMPONENT OF`:The x component of the specified vector, usually representing a leftward amount.
 - `    VALUE`:The vector from which to acquire the x component.


`Y COMPONENT OF`:The y component of the specified vector, usually representing an upward amount.
 - `    VALUE`:The vector from which to acquire the y component.


`Z COMPONENT OF`:The z component of the specified vector, usually representing a forward amount.
 - `    VALUE`:The vector from which to acquire the z component.
